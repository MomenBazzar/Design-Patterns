# Singleton Design Pattern
### Problem:
In some situations, we need to have only one instance of a class in the entire application. For example, a database connection manager class should have only one instance of a database connection throughout the application. Creating multiple instances of the database connection manager class would waste resources and could result in conflicts with the database.

### Definition:
The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created
in the entire application. The Singleton Design Pattern provides a way to control the instantiation of a class and
ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the entire application.

### Solution:
The Singleton Design Pattern can be implemented by making the class constructor private and creating a public static method that returns the instance of the class. This method is responsible for creating a new instance of the class if it does not exist and returning the existing instance if it does.

Here is an example of implementing a Singleton class in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance = null;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

```

n this example, the class constructor is private, so it cannot be instantiated from outside the class. The static getInstance() method is used to get the instance of the class. The first time getInstance() is called, it creates a new instance of the class, and subsequent calls return the existing instance.

### Consider using when:
- We need only one instance of a class throughout the application.
- We want to control the instantiation of a class and ensure that only one instance of the class exists in the entire application.nt to hide the complexity of object creation from the client code.
